## Goal of the analysis

The goal of my analysis was to determine what makes a song popular from a linguistic point of view.

When I originally came up with the idea, that I want to analyse lyrics, I thought it would be interesting to see difference in genres, but than I thought about how my music consumption changed over time. My favorite songs talk about very different topics nowadays than 5-10 years ago. Is it just me, who while growing up started to listen to all kinds of different music, with deeper meaning, or it's a general trend we can see over time? Do the most popular songs always talk about the same things, or do they have different topics? Do these topics change over time? Could we maybe use text analysis to come up with a song ourselves?

These are the questions that I would like to answer using the methods I acquired in class.
